# Billionaire App
Welcome to the Billionaire App, a Flutter application designed with a focus on user experience and rich functionality. This app demonstrates various Flutter concepts and features, making it an excellent resource for developers and users alike.

## Features
1. Dark Mode
Dark Mode has been implemented to provide a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
The mode can be toggled between light and dark themes, ensuring that users can choose their preferred visual setting.
2. Shared Preferences
Shared Preferences are used to persist user settings such as the selected theme (light/dark mode).
The app remembers user preferences even after it is closed, offering a seamless experience.
3. Stateful Widgets
Stateful Widgets are utilized to manage dynamic content within the app, such as displaying the current balance.
The balance is updated in real-time, allowing users to see changes immediately.
4. Initialization with initState
The app makes use of the initState method to initialize data when the widget is first created.
This ensures that the app's state is set up correctly before the user interacts with it.
5. UI Updates with setState
The setState method is used extensively to update the UI in response to user actions, ensuring that changes are reflected immediately.
This contributes to a responsive and interactive user interface.
6. Icon Customization
The app icon has been customized to give it a unique identity that aligns with the theme of wealth and success.
A professional and distinctive icon enhances the app's presence on the user's device.
7. Parent-Child and Child-Parent Communication
The app demonstrates parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication patterns.
This includes passing data between widgets and handling callbacks, ensuring efficient data flow within the app.
